# DFS-UCS_WebTutor
## By: Jared Kaiser & Bryce Bales
This is a project for CS 475: Artificial Intelligence. It is a web-based program to show users how to use the DFS and UFS search algorithms.

## The Problem:
Search algorithms can often be hard to gauge whenever we are just looking at static images and numbers describing the algorithms. We want to help students understand how BFS and DFS work by making a visual representation using a GUI with a short description next to it. By doing this we aim to make the mystique behind how these search algorithms work no longer a mystery, but something that is easier to grasp and understand.

## Our Plan:
We plan to make a web-based program using HTML and CSS for the front end and using Python for the back end to get the visual representation to move. We are combining techniques by using different front-end and back-end languages. The problem is small enough to be completed on time because we are only using 2 search algorithms and we both have prior experience in HTML, CSS, and Python. We foresee the animation of the proper implementation of each search algorithm to be a challenge as well as making sure that the back end works seamlessly with the front end.
